RHUNTER

A little bit about why this code: I'm studying Rust, and I like to get my hands dirty. I learn fast by doing it instead of just reading.

So, I've created this simple skeleton of an antivirus. 

I hope in the future this become a more serious project.

Future:
- Create a module for the Linux kernel that can consult the syscall table, take a "snapshot", and if there are any changes in the addresses, I can alert through my antivirus.
- Look into Elf files
- Script to test perfomance and if looses any events.
- Implement Async because of the Hasher and Logger.
- Local database too compare hashes.
- Module that will update database.
